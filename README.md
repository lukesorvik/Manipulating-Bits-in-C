# Store Management System

## Overview
This project provides a Store Management System implemented in C. It includes functionalities to manage aisles within a store, refill stock from a stockroom, fulfill orders, and more. The system leverages bitwise operators, bitmasks, control structures, pointers, and arrays to efficiently manage store operations.


## Key Features
- **Aisle Management**: Functions for manipulating individual aisles, including retrieving section information, toggling spaces, and rotating items.
- **Store Operations**: Operations for interacting with multiple aisles and a stockroom, such as refilling from stockroom, fulfilling orders, and managing sections.
- **Efficient Implementation**: Leveraging bitwise operators, bitmasks, control structures, pointers, and arrays to optimize store operations.
- **Testing Utilities**: Tools for testing the correctness of implemented functions, including executables for specific and wide range of inputs.

## Lab Structure
The project consists of two main components: `aisle_manager.c` and `store_client.c`.

### Aisle Manager (`aisle_manager.c`)
The `aisle_manager.c` file contains functions for managing individual aisles within the store. These functions implement various operations such as retrieving section information, toggling spaces, adding or removing items, and rotating items within an aisle.

### Store Client (`store_client.c`)
The `store_client.c` file provides functions for interacting with multiple aisles and a stockroom in the store. It includes operations such as refilling aisles from the stockroom, fulfilling orders based on aisle contents, and managing sections within aisles.
